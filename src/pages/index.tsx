              <p>
                The Guardian’s agenda-setting journalism is underpinned by an
                independent ownership structure that is different from other
                global news organisations. It guarantees our journalism and our
                editor stay independent from any outside influence, whether
                financial, political or commercial.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1936, John Russell Scott — the proprietor of the Manchester
                Guardian, as it was then known — transferred his family’s stake
                in the newspaper to a group of trustees. The Scott Trust became
                the owner of the newspaper, putting in place the independent
                ownership structure that supports the Guardian to this day.
              </p>
              <p>
                This independent ownership structure is made up of three key
                organisations:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Scott Trust</strong>, the sole shareholder of
                  Guardian Media Group. The purpose — and privilege — of the
                  Trust is to secure the financial and editorial independence of
                  the Guardian in perpetuity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Scott Trust Endowment</strong>, a fund built up
                  following the prudent sale of assets with the core purpose of
                  investing to provide financial returns to support Guardian
                  journalism in perpetuity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Guardian Media Group</strong>, the owner of Guardian
                  News &amp; Media (GNM) and publisher of the Guardian newspaper
                  and website.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This exceptional, if not unique, form of governance for a news
                publisher ensures that all surplus financial returns are
                reinvested into our high quality journalism for a global
                audience rather than benefiting a proprietor or shareholders.
              </p>
              <p>
                A summary of the governance structure is available{" "}
